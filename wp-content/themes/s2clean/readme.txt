== Installation ==

1. Upload the `/s2clean` folder to your `/wp-content/themes/` directory.
2. Activate the theme through the `Appearance->Themes` menu in WordPress®.
3. Navigate to the `Theme Options Panel` for configuration details.

***Uploading tips:** You may find it takes a long time to upload this theme to your server. That's because it comes with multiple color variations. If you'd like to exclude some of the color variations, you can go into the `/colors/` directory, before you upload everything. Feel free to delete the color folders you don't intend to use. The only one that absolutely has to be uploaded, is: `/colors/default/`, all of the others are optional. Note... you should NEVER exclude `/colors/default/`. That directory needs to be present at all times.*

***Special instructions for Multisite Blog Farms:** If you're installing this theme on WordPress® with Multisite/Networking enabled, and you run a Blog Farm ( i.e. you give away free blogs to the public ); please `define("MULTISITE_FARM", true);` in your /wp-config.php file. When this theme is running on a Multisite Blog Farm, it will mutate itself ( including its menus ) for safe compatiblity with Blog Farms. You don't need to do this unless you run a Blog Farm. If you're running the standard version of WordPress®, or you run WordPress® Multisite to host your own sites, you can ( and should ) skip this step.*

== Description ==

Introducing ~the s2Clean Theme for WordPress®. Threaded comment discussions, full-page layouts, easy-columns, CSS utility classes, and a powerful Theme Options Panel on the back-end. Theme Options make it SUPER easy to configure. Upload your own logo image, configure your navigation menus, set excerpt / thumbnail options... and more. The s2Clean theme has been pre-integrated with the s2Member plugin for WordPress®. It's never been easier to run a premium website &amp; build a residual income.

s2Clean comes with an expanding Login Box at the very top of every page; designed to keep Customers on the front-end of your site. s2Clean also comes with an easy-to-use template for your Login Welcome Page, a built-in Profile Editing Panel that supports Custom Fields; plus four different widgetized bars - two of which are displayed only when a User/Member is logged in. s2Clean makes extensive use of s2Member's API Constants. It's a great way to see s2Member in action. s2Clean can be used out-of-the-box, or as a starting point for a larger project. The s2Clean framework includes over 200 WordPress® Hooks/Filters making it highly extensible.

A lightbox system has been pre-integrated into this theme. Set `rel="boxopen"` to apply it. For example, ( `<a rel="boxopen"></a>` ). The lightbox system has also been pre-integrated with the gallery system native to WordPress®. If you insert a gallery shortcode, the lightbox system will automatically attach itself, so that your image galleries become more interactive with very little effort on your part.

This theme supports easy-column layouts, full page layouts, sidebar layouts, and over 100 CSS Utility Class combinations. This theme comes packaged with multiple color variations. This theme operates as a website first, and as a blog second. In other words, it comes with full support for all of the blogging tools available for WordPress®, but the overall design and structure of this theme are geared toward a full fledge website, and not just a blog.

Six different Page Templates are included. 1. The default Page Template with a Sidebar, 2. Full Width Page ( no sidebar ), 3. Contact Form Page ( displays a pre-integrated contact form ), 4. Archives ( displays blog archives ), 5. Links ( displays your link categories ), 6. Background Only ( clean ), which is just an empty Page that could be used for popup window content, promotional landing pages, or anything else that you want complete control over. Two additional Page Templates are provided for the s2Member Login Welcome Page. The s2 Login Welcome Page ( w/ sidebar ), and the s2 Login Welcome Page ( w/o sidebar ).

The horizontal Navigation Menu at the top of this theme supports an unlimited nested hierarchy. It may contain a combination of Pages and/or Categories. You can have as many Pages and Categories in the menu as you need to. From your Theme Options Panel, you can choose which Navigation Layout Model you prefer. Pages Only, Categories Only, Page w/nested Categories, Categories w/nested Pages, or a Custom WordPress® Menu ( requires WP 3.0+ ).<!--more-->

There are two widgetized bars for this theme, broken down into four separate panels for s2Member. The Sidebar can hold an unlimited number of widgets, and so can the Footbar ( 3 across, with unlimited rows ). This theme includes three pre-installed widgets that may come in handy. The *Super Tags* widget, the *Ad Codes* widget, and the *Ad Squares* widget. The *Ad Codes* widget accepts any type of XHTML or JavaScript, including Google® Adsense.

A full comprehensive Options Panel comes integrated into WordPress® for this theme. There are MANY customizations that can be performed. The Home Page for this theme is configurable through the built-in Theme Options Panel. You can either display your most recent Posts ( in a variety of ways, or from a variety of Categories, with Sticky Post options ). Or, you can use a static Page that you create inside WordPress®. Your Home Page can also be displayed with or without a widgetized Sidebar.

This theme has been pre-integrated with AddThis®. AddThis® is a free one-step sharing tool that saves you time and makes sharing online hassle free. You can share anything on the web using an array of social bookmarking options, Facebook®, Twitter®, post-to-profile and blog choices, Email, AIM, or even as a text message to a mobile phone. AddThis® supports an additional JavaScript API for developers that need more control over what is being shared. This theme has been fully integrated with WordPress® and the AddThis® API. It works beautifully, no additional configuration needed.

This theme was built on our rock solid framework for WordPress® powered websites & blogs. Our framework, the [WebSharks Framework](http://www.primothemes.com/about/framework/), is a fancy name for what is essentially a core set of PHP, JavaScript and CSS files that have been professionally assembled for the production of high quality themes, plugins and widgets for WordPress®. This framework was crafted with a focus on uniform coding standards, GPL licensing flexibility, and the organization of team-driven efforts within our company and the entire WordPress® community.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the template for the s2 Login Welcome Page? =
It's already built-in, ready to go. Just navigate to `WordPress® -> Pages -> Add New`. You'll see a drop-down menu for Page Templates. Choose: `s2 Login Welcome Page` and click Publish. You can add some content of your own to this Page as well. There is a live demo [here](http://dev.primothemes.com/s2clean/account/). Username is `demo`, password is `demo`.

= How hard is it to swap out the logo with my own? =
It's a piece of cake. There is an option for this under: Theme Options. You can upload your logo using the Media Library in WordPress®. You can also upload a custom Favicon image if you wish.

= Does this theme support threaded comments? =
Yes, you just need to enable threaded comments within WordPress®. See: `Settings -> Discussion`.

= Does this theme support Gravatars? =
Yes, it not only supports the use of Gravatars, but it also provides an intuitive interface for visitors that do not have a Gravatar yet. You can test this out by typing an email address into the comment form. If there is no Gravatar associated with your email address, a special avatar is displayed that says: "No Gravatar?, Get one!". If clicked, it spawns a popup window that leads to Gravatar.com. The idea is to give everyone the opportunity to get their own Gravatar if they want to.

= Does this theme support the `--nextpage--` tag? =
Yes, this theme has support for `<!--nextpage-->`, the `<!--more-->` tag, search capabilities, content excerpts, sticky posts, links, archives & thumbnails. Chances are, if WordPress® can do it, this theme will support it. We try to think of everything. If there IS something not supported by this theme, please shout in our direction, because we would love to hear about it.

= How can I open larger images in a lightbox window? =
A lightbox system has been pre-integrated into this theme. Set `rel="boxopen"` to apply it. For example, ( `<a href="http://..." rel="boxopen"></a>` ). The lightbox system has also been pre-integrated with the gallery system native to WordPress®. If you insert a gallery Shortcode, the lightbox system will automatically attach itself, so that your image galleries become more interactive with very little effort on your part. This technique of using `rel="boxopen"` also works for normal URLs, not just images. Options can also be added, like this: ( `<a href="http://..." rel="boxopen;options={width:300,height:300}"></a>` ). For more detailed information, see `/includes/jquery/jquery.boxopen/jquery.boxopen.js` for documenation on this extension for jQuery.

= Is there an easy way to open popup browser windows? =
Yes, in addition to the lightbox system that comes pre-integrated into this theme, there is another extension that supports ( `<a href="http://..." rel="winopen"></a>` ). So instead of opening a page inside a lightbox, this will open a URL in an entirely new browser window. You can also set the width and height using this format. ( `<a href="http://..." rel="winopen;options={width:300,height:300}"></a>` ). For more detailed information, see `/includes/jquery/jquery.winopen/jquery.winopen.js` for documenation on this extension for jQuery.

= Does this theme support Google® Analytics? =
Yes, check your Theme Options Panel for the Global XHTML code section. You can paste your Google® Analytics code there. The Global XHTML field supports other tracking methods as well. You can insert any XHTML or JavaScript code into that field and it will be displayed globally at the very bottom of your site. Your Global XHTML code will even be loaded into Pages that use the Background Only template. It is called Global, because it is ALWAYS loaded, for every file. This field is specifically designed for tracking codes.

= Is this theme widget-ready? =
Yes, absolutely. This theme even includes three pre-installed widgets that may come in handy. The *Super Tags* widget, the *Ad Codes* widget, and the *Ad Squares* widget. The *Ad Codes* widget accepts any type of XHTML or JavaScript, including Google® Adsense.

= Can I remove the credits at the bottom? =
Yes, it's perfectly ok to remove our credit and copyright notice from the bottom. We've made it very easy for you to do this. Check the Theme Options Panel for the Lower Footbar Companion. You can modify everything in that section easily.

= Does this theme support custom fields? =
Yes. WordPress® allows you to assign Custom Fields to Posts &amp; Pages. This arbitrary extra information is known as Meta Data. This theme creates a new panel on both your Post and Page creation forms, titled: *Custom Fields Used By This Theme*. Please refer to that panel for detailed descriptions about how these Custom Fields will be used when they're provided. For example, all of our themes understand the `h1_title` field. A description of each Custom Field will be made available to you whenever you add or edit content inside WordPress®.

= Are all source files included, even the Flash® files? =
Yes, all source files are included. PHP, JavaScript, PNG, PSD, FLA, SWF, etc, etc. We include everything that you might need to make further adjustments.

= I want to dig in, where do I find the CSS files? =
You can modify the color scheme easily using the drop-down menu in the Theme Options Panel. We've also provided you with a special section in the Theme Options Panel where you can add your own Custom CSS and JavaScript. In other words, digging through the files for this theme should not be needed in most cases. That being said, this theme CAN be tweaked further by qualified web developers. If you'd like some intuitive assistance, please contact PriMoThemes.com for custom development quotes. If you're an aspiring web developer, and you just want to tweak things a little here and there; please check your WordPress® theme directory under: `/colors`. Depending on which color variation you're using, you will need to select a sub-folder from that directory and locate the CSS files for that specific color variation. If you need help, you can read our [Framework Documentation](http://www.primothemes.com/about/framework/).

= What the heck is (X)HTML? =
If you know HTML, you'll have no problem writing XHTML, because for all practical purposes, it is the same thing. If you'd like to learn more about the subtle differences between HTML and XHTML, please try [this article](http://www.w3schools.com/Xhtml/xhtml_html.asp).

= I added some widgets but they look kinda funky, what gives? =
With any theme, including ours, you can only generalize the CSS styling for widgets. There is no way to pre-determine which widgets you may decide to use. Sometimes, widgets you download from the WordPress.org site will come with their own CSS style sheets or specific rules, and sometimes they will not. The bottom line is that if you decide to use non-standardized widgets ( those not included with WordPress® by default, or with this theme ), then you will need to create your own CSS rules and style them yourself, so they jive with your overall layout. Some widgets will be too wide, others too narrow, and others just look funKy. Check the documentation for each widget you're having problems with first, and if all else fails, use your Theme Options Panel to add Custom CSS rules that address your concerns.

= Which browsers will my theme be compatible with? =
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops interoperable technologies (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to lead the web to its full potential. Their validator checks the markup validity of web documents in HTML & XHTML. Our themes have passed all of the W3C validation guidelines. Our themes are cross-browser compatible. They will function properly on all PC & Mac based operating systems; and with the following browsers:

* Internet Explorer 7+ ( yes, including version 8+ )
* Firefox® 1.5+ ( yes, including versions 2 & 3+ )
* Safari 3+ ( yes, including version 4+ )
* AOL® Browsers with IE7+
* iPhone® / AppleWebKit
* iPad® / AppleWebKit
* Google® Chrome
* Opera® 9+

They will also function with lesser-known browsers using Gecko/Trident/Presto/WebKit and other modern engines. Here is a [full list of browsers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers).

Outdated browsers include:
IE6, Netscape & older versions of AOL. IE6 is all but extinct. IE6 users MUST upgrade to IE7+. IE6 has lots of issues with modern websites and fails to deliver consistent results. Our themes do NOT support IE6 for a variety of reasons; including security, the lack of support for PNG graphics, the lack of support for CSS selectors, box-model issues, hover support, and the list goes on. Please read the [IE6 obituary notice](http://ripie6.com/) for further details.

= What is the WebSharks Framework? =
PriMoThemes.com is owned &amp; operated by WebSharks, Inc. The [WebSharks Framework](http://www.primothemes.com/about/framework/) is a fancy name for what is essentially a core set of PHP, JavaScript and CSS files that have been professionally assembled for the production of high quality themes, plugins and widgets for WordPress®.

== Troubleshooting Tips ==

= My content appears broken. =
Check the Formatting Configuration in your Theme Options Panel. By default, WordPress® comes with several Formatting Filters built into its publishing system. Advanced users may find them annoying, particularly if you already know XHTML and you're not using the Visual Editor for WordPress®. These Formatting Filters include: `wpautop, balanceTags, wptexturize, convert_chars & convert_smilies`. The most important Filter is `wpautop`. It converts double line-breaks in your content into paragraphs (`<p>...</p>`). The other Filters, well, they do a few different things, but for the most part, they're responsible for keeping your code clean, handling XHTML entity conversions for special characters like ampersands, and balancing the overall structure of your code. All of that being said, if you plan to write your own XHTML, without the assistance of the Visual Editor, you can safely disable these Filters to prevent your raw code from being modified by them.

***Broken Content:** If you've already created Posts/Pages using the Visual Editor for WordPress®, disabling these Filters can cause your existing content to appear broken. For example, the `wpautop` filter converts double line-breaks in your content into paragraphs (`<p>...</p>`). So, if you've already published a lot of content that depends on automatic paragraphs, and then you disable `wpautop`, your content will become jumbled. Just keep this in mind if you disable these Filters, and then find your content in a mess. It is easy to think your theme is to blame, when actually it is just these Filters at work, or not at work. In either case, the problem will be temporary, not permanent. To correct the issue, adjust your configuration.*

= The navigation and overall layout look way out of whack. =
Depending on how many Pages and/or Categories you have, it is possible that you are seeing run-offs. These will cause your theme to appear broken. However, this is really a simple problem to correct. This happens because the navigation sections of your theme are designed to hold a limited number of *parent* Categories and/or *parent* Pages. This is not a limitation of the theme itself, but rather a configuration issue.

Obviously, you cannot have 200 *parent* pages, each holding their own *parent* tab or navigation slot. You'll need to work on nesting Pages and/or Categories together logically so they all fit within the layout of your theme. You can do this using tools already built into WordPress®. All of our themes support an unlimited nested hierarchy, so once you limit the number of top level Pages and/or Categories down to a manageable number... ( nesting everything else into child items beneath those top level sections ), your theme will straighten itself out.

Alternatively, you can use the Theme Options Panel to correct this problem as well. Look under Theme Options -> `Page Navigation` and `Category Navigation`. There you can choose which specific Pages and/or Categories you want to include or exclude from the navigation system used by the theme. Doing it this way allows you to keep your existing site structure, and include a limited subset of your content in the navigation system for the theme.

= I changed the color options, now my logo is missing. =
Remember, each color variation uses its own set of images. So that means you'll need to create a logo image for each color variation. This is actually a feature, since it is often a good idea to decorate your logo based on the season; or at least based on the main color of your overall theme. Also, whenever you change the color option, using the drop-down menu in your Theme Options, that change is automatically propagated down through the remaining option fields. This ensures that URL locations pointing to images inside a particular color/ directory are updated as they should be.

= My logo image is not 100% transparent. It seems to bleed around the edges. =
This theme uses a 24-bit PNG logo image with *alpha* transparency. If the logo that you created is bleeding off its edges; in other words, not blending into the coloration behind it, this means that you probably created a GIF image, or an 8-bit PNG *without* alpha transparency.

Portable Network Graphics (PNG) is a bit-mapped image format that employs loss-less data compression. PNG was created to improve upon and replace GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) as an image-file format not requiring a patent license. The PNG acronym is optionally recursive, unofficially standing for (PNG's Not GIF). For the Web, PNG really has three main advantages over GIF: alpha channels (variable transparency), gamma correction (cross-platform control of image brightness), and two-dimensional interlacing (a method of progressive display). PNG also compresses better than GIF.

= I generated a Favicon &amp; uploaded it, but it is not showing up in my browser. =
First, make sure that **after** you upload your favicon.ico file, you log into your WordPress® Dashboard and update your Theme Options; by configuring the proper location for your favicon ICO file. If that does not do the trick, it is probably an issue with browser caching. Browsers, including Firefox &amp; IE both, tend to store and retrieve Favicon images very infrequently. Probably to conserve resources and eliminate repeated connections to servers. You may have to reset your browser cache ( or even reboot your system ) in order to see the updated Favicon image. We have even seen it take 48 hours before a browser will re-validate Favicon images.
