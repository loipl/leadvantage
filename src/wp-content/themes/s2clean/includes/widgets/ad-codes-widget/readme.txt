Supports AdSenseÂ®, Javascript, XHTML and PHP code. The Ad Codes widget allows you to place ANY size banner ( ad, ads, advertisements ) into a widget-ready bar for WordPressÂ®. PHP code can be disabled for security when its installed on a Multisite Blog Farm.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `/ad-codes-widget` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPressÂ®.
3. Navigate to `Appearance->Widgets` and add the widget.

***Special instructions for Multisite Blog Farms:** If you're installing this plugin on WordPressÂ® with Multisite/Networking enabled, and you run a Blog Farm ( i.e. you give away free blogs to the public ); please `define("MULTISITE_FARM", true);` in your /wp-config.php file. When this plugin is running on a Multisite Blog Farm, it will mutate itself ( including its menus ) for safe compatiblity with Blog Farms. You don't need to do this unless you run a Blog Farm. If you're running the standard version of WordPressÂ®, or you run WordPressÂ® Multisite to host your own sites, you can ( and should ) skip this step.*

== Description ==

The Ad Codes widget allows you to place ANY size banner into a widget-ready bar for WordPressÂ®. You can paste HTML, JavaScript, an IFrame, or even PHP code into this widget without any problem at all. The Ad Codes widget also supports multi-widget options, so you can add more than one banner to your sidebar, or even more than one size if you’'d like. This widget also supports shuffle-rotations, allowing you to place more than one ad code into a single widget box. All you do is separate each code block using a special `<!--rotate-->` tag.

The Ad Codes widget supports embedded PHP code. If you know a little PHP scripting, you could add conditionals to the code that you place into this widget. For example, if you wanted to show different ads based on the category that is currently being displayed on your blog, you could do something like this:<!--more-->

	<?php if(is_category("green-lizards")): ?>

	  insert green lizard ad campaign here

	<?php elseif(is_category("purple-socks")): ?>

	  insert purple socks ad here

	<?php else: ?>

	  insert default ad code here

	<?php endif; ?>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the best size ( width x height ) to use? =
The recommended size is 336x280, but it does not have to be that exact size. You can use ANY size you like.

= What type of code can I put in? =
Feel free to paste any type of ad code into the squares. AdSenseÂ®, XHTML, PHP, IFrame, JavaScript, whatever.

= Can I automatically rotate various ad codes? =
If you'd like to rotate a few different ads, just insert this tag: `<!--rotate-->` between every ad code that you want to rotate through. All of your codes go into the one single form field, separated by the `<!--rotate-->` tag.
